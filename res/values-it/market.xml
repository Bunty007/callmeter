  <string name="market_about" formatted="false" orig="Call Meter lets you keep an eye on your mobile plans.\n\nIt shows statistics of your calls/sms/txt/data traffic and lets you set limits for each of these plans.\nCall Meter supports a huge amount of billing modes to let you adapt it\'s behaviour to your operators billing.">Thanks!I think when applied to giruanemm fuzzes like the FuzzFace, the battery difference becomes slightly more obvious.  Although I don\'t claim to have golden ears like Eric, I can feel a slight \'sag\' in tone in Duracells as opposed to the brighter, more immediate sounding Energizers.
