About Studio, I think you\'re inixmg two different things. Multiterm handles glossaries only, so if you want to import a TM, you don\'t need it at all (you can still install it separately from My Downloads in SDL.com).Since you\'ve already aligned the project, you should have a TMX file. If you don\'t have it yet, go to the WinAlign file and select to export it as a TMX. Then, you should create a new TM directly in Studio or use an existing TM. Finally, go to the Translation Memories view (the very last button on the left side of the screen) and open the new or existing TM. You should see it in the left side panel, right-click on it and select Import. Select the TMX file you created with WinAlign and that\'s it.Good luck,Claudia</string>
