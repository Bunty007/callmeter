	<string name="about0_">Watch your call, message and data plans!</string>
	<string name="about0">CallMeter generates reports from call, message and data logs. It supports several modes of billing.</string>
	<string name="about1">The output format is usage / time or count used this billing period / time or count overall. Monthly time calculation takes the billing mode into account. Overall does not.</string>
	<string name="about2">The billing mode specifies the length of the first / next billing intervals. E.g. 60/10 means every call is billed for minimum 60s, any longer call is rounded up to next full 10s.</string>
	<string name="about3">You can split your call or message plan into up to two plans. Each plan can be set to be totally free, capped to a set limit or unlimited.</string>
	<string name="about4">Your messages can be merged into your call plan. E.g. counting every message as a 15s call.</string>
	<string name="about5">CallMeter runs in background every 30min (only if not in standby). This means, that deleting calls or messages older than 30min will not change your stats. Deleting calls or messages younger than 30min may result in wrong statistics.</string>
	<string name="about6_">What does CallMeter NG not do:</string>
	<string name="about6">There is no way to distinguish between sipdroid and real calls or between websms and real sms. Android\'s seamless integration of these apps makes it impossible to retrieve application-specific data from call logs.</string>
