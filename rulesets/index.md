#Import rule sets

Import a rule set of your choice directly to your Call Meter 3G simply by clicking the link on your device or scanning the barcode with a barcode scanner app (e.g. [Barcode Scanner][1]).
You might need to edit your very own limit or cost settings after importing the rule set.

If you want your rule set shown here, you just need to export it to me from within the app.
